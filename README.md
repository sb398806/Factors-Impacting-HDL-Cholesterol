# Factors-Impacting-HDL-Cholesterol-in-Adult-Females
Part I of the second data science project completed for Statistical Methods I. National Health &amp; Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2022 (NHANES 2017-2022) data was used to complete four analyses exploring factors impacting HDL cholesterol in females ages 30 - 55.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
-  Data management - merging, cleaning data sets
-  Descriptive and exploratory data summaries across groups for each outcome
-  Developing attractive and well-constructed visualizations, graphs and tables
-  Comparing population mean differences for at least one quantitative outcome across a set of two (or three) groups, demonstrating appropriate reasons behind procedural choices
-  Comparing population proportions for categorical outcomes across exposure groups and appropriately interpreting point estimates and confidence intervals
